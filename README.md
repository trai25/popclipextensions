Brett's PopClip Extensions
=================

My growing collection of [PopClip][popclip] extensions.

## Installation

This repository only includes these as source bundles
(`.popclipext`), not packaged `.popclipextz` versions. To
install, just make sure the extension of a folder is
`.popclipext` and double click it in Finder. An up-to-date
package of the bundled versions is [available on my
site](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/bretts-popclip-extensions).

<!--README-->

_Current release version: **<!--VER-->2.0.4<!--END VER-->** ([source code](https://github.com/ttscoff/popclipextensions/releases/tag/<!--VER-->2.0.4<!--END VER-->))_
([source
code](https://github.com/ttscoff/popclipextensions/releases/tag/<!--VER-->1.44.8<!--END
VER-->))_

> Many of these extensions have alternate behaviors when
> holding modifier keys. Recent versions of PopClip override
> these variations and provide specific actions when holding
> modifiers, such as Shift to copy result and Option to
> display the result in the bar. This means that the
> variations in the plugins no longer function. A better
> system may be available in the future, but for now, to
> restore the modifier key functionality, you need to
> disable the global interpretation of them. Open Terminal
> and run this command:
>
>       defaults write com.pilotmoon.popclip DisableAlternateActions -bool YES

## Extensions

The extensions currently included in the bundle. Some are
available elsewhere as well, but this collection will always
be the most up-to-date versions.

<!--EXTENSIONS-->
### Blockquote

Turn indented text (or any text) into nested Markdown blockquotes.

* Clicking adds a ">" for each indentation level in the selected text
* Command-click to decrease quote level
* Command-Option-click key to remove all quoting

When adding quote levels, multiple line breaks between lines creates separate block quotes (by design). If there's a single blank line between to paragraphs, they'll be joined together as paragraphs within a blockquote. More than one starts a new quote.




### CheckURLs

PopClip extension to show a popup preview for each URL in selected text. Used for confirming the output of scripts like SearchLink without switching to the browser.

Links are shown sequentially in the order they're found.

## Changelog

- 2026-08-17: Fix to handle refocusing frontmost app before paste-after

### Code

Turn selected text into Markdown inline code or a code block. This extension "toggles," so if the selection already contains code syntax (inline code or fenced code block) the syntax is removed.

Detects whether there are multiple lines: 

* if not, it surrounds the input with single backticks
* if so, it wraps the block in triple backticks (fenced)

When creating an inline code block, it will also detect whitespace at the beginning and end of the selection and make sure that it's excluded from the surrounding backticks.


### Comment

Turn selected text into an HTML or code comment.

Choose a style from the submenu:

* **\<!--**: `<!-- block of text -->`
* **/\***: `/* block of text */`
* **#**: `# before each line`
* **//**: `// before each line`


### CopyPLUS

PopClip extension to append the selection to the current contents in the clipboard. *This is a duplicate of an existing extension (Append) with just slightly better UTF-8 handling, and modifier key handling for copying with and without linebreaks and whitespace.*

* Hold Command (⌘) when clicking to add an extra line break between entries.
* Hold Option (⌥) to append with no extra whitespace.


### CopyURLS

PopClip extension to copy just the URLs in the selection, one per line.

Duplicate of OpenURLS, but copies URLs to the clipboard instead of opening them in a browser.

- **Option**: join lines first to repair URLs broken across line breaks


### CriticMarkup

Allows the quick insertion of [CriticMarkup][] syntax via a submenu. Optionally fill in a signature to have a comment included after every insert, deletion or change with your initials or name.

- Highlight
- Delete
- Insert
- Change
- Comment

[CriticMarkup]: http://criticmarkup.com/spec.php

There _is_ a PopClip extension for CriticMarkup in the main download package, which I didn't realize when I whipped this one up. I may defer to that one eventually, but I'll wait until I figure out if mine adds anything worthwhile or not.

## Changelog

- 2026-08-01: Updated to use TypeScript and submenu options instead of modifier keys

### DefineAbbr

PopClip extension to search textingabbreviations.ca for the selected string.


### Editor

Extension for adding HTML editor marks to text. Choose a style from the submenu:

- **Mark**: `<mark>` (highlight)
- **Insert**: `<ins datetime></ins>` (insertion)
- **Delete**: `<del datetime></del>` (deletion)
- **Comment**: `<!-- -->` (comment)

Insert and Delete include a `datetime` attribute when **Include Datetime** is enabled in the extension options.


### FixPoorlyObscuredEmails

Fixes emails obscured in a "support AT mydomain DOT com" fashion.

Hold Option to also open an email window for each matched address. This feature does not require edit capability in the current field.


### HardWrap

Add or remove hard wrapping of paragraphs. Choose an action from the submenu:

* **Wrap**: wrap lines at the configured column (default 80)
* **Unwrap**: join hard-wrapped lines within paragraphs, preserving blank lines between paragraphs

Set the wrap width with the **Column** option in the extension settings.


### Increment Templated

PopClip extension to increment and repeat templated text.

Select and run on the following text:

```
This is a numeric increment ##0..2##.
```

Which will generate:

```
This is a numeric increment 0.
This is a numeric increment 1.
```

Specify a value to increment by with `##START..INCREMENT..END##`, e.g. `##0..2..10##` would insert 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

![Increment Templated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttscoff/popclipextensions/master/increment.gif)

#### Placeholders

You can use placeholders with basic math modification. `##x##` inserts the current element again. `##i##` inserts the 0-based index in the iteration. So if the template is `##5..7##`, on the second iteration `x` would hold `6` and `i` would hold `1`.

Apply math functions to the placeholders using basic operator symbols (including `%` for mod). To insert the current value times 10, use `##x*10##`. More complex equations are allowed, e.g. `##(i+2)*10##`. Use `%` for modulus.

You can include leading zeroes on math operations to pad the result. If you want to just pad the number without modifying, you would use `##x*0001##`, which would turn `5` into `0005` and `50` into `0050`. Including a 0 padding on any element of the equation will result in padded output.


#### String Arrays

You can also use arrays of strings or numbers:

```
Hello ##mother,father,sister,brother##. And repeat with ##x##.
```

Yields:

```
Hello mother. And repeat with mother.
Hello father. And repeat with father.
Hello sister. And repeat with sister.
Hello brother. And repeat with brother.
```

The `##i##` placeholder (zero-based index) with math operators is also available in string array replacements. If you want the index to also refer to strings, add `#list,of,strings` after the index or equation, e.g. `##i%2#odd,even##` to insert `odd` and `even` alternately with each iteration.

Example:

```
.element-##one,two,three## {
    text-indent: ##i*10##px;
}
```

```
.element-one {
    text-indent: 0px;
}
.element-two {
    text-indent: 10px;
}
.element-three {
    text-indent: 20px;
}
```


### LinkCleaner

PopClip extension to lengthen and clean URLs in the selection, then paste the result.

Uses the [StretchLink.cc](https://stretchlink.cc/) API for expansion and tracking cleanup.

- **Command**: copy cleaned text instead of pasting
- **Command-Option**: copy just the cleaned URL(s)

#### Options

- **Tidy Amazon URLs**: when enabled, adds StretchLink's `tidy_amazon` parameter to tidy all Amazon product links.


### Markdown to Mindmap

Takes a selection of plain text containing markdown headlines, list items and paragraphs and converts it into a format ready for pasting into a mind mapping application (such as MindNode, MindManager or MindMeister) as separate nodes/topics.

List indentation is normalized to tabs. Nested lists that use **2-space** or **4-space** indents are detected automatically; lines that are already tab-indented are left as tabs.


### Markdownify

Turn HTML text into Markdown using html2text.


### MDList

PopClip extension to turn lines of text into Markdown lists. Choose an action from the submenu:

* **-**: unordered list (markers cycle `*`, `-`, `+` by nesting level)
* **1.**: numbered list (renumbers existing items; converts bullets to numbers)
* **X**: clear list markers

Indentation is handled as nested lists. Existing markers are overwritten when converting between bullet and numbered styles.

## Changelog

- 2026-08-01: Convert to use TS and submenus

### nvUltra

[nvUltra](https://nvultra.com) extension for PopClip. Add text as new note to frontmost notebook, or define a notebook in settings.

#### Credits

Originally created by Marc Abramowitz - see [https://github.com/msabramo/nvALT.popclipext](https://github.com/msabramo/nvALT.popclipext).  Icon and minor modifications by Nick Moore.

## Changelog

- 2026-08-01: Update to use TypeScript

### OpenURLS

PopClip extension to open all URLS in selection.

- **Option**: join lines first to repair URLs broken across line breaks


### Outdent

Outdents the selection while keeping relative nesting.

* Click to remove the shared leading indent from all lines
* **Command**: fully strip leading whitespace from every line


### PoorText

Make rich text go broke.

Strips rich text formatting from selection. There are probably multiple others that do this, but it's so easy I just made it myself.


PreviewURL
===

PopClip extension to show a popup preview for each URL in selected text.


### BulletList

PopClip extension to turn lines of text into Markdown bullet items. Indentation is handled as nested lists and existing markers are overwritten (numbered list becomes bullet list).

#### Numbered lists

Holding Option (⌥) while clicking the button for the extension in the PopClip bar will create/update a numbered list instead. When the list is already a numbered list, it will be re-numbered to fix any gaps or out-of-order numbering within nest levels.

#### Clear list formatting

Holding Command (⌘) while clicking will remove all list prefixes.

#### Bullet format

When you install this extension, you'll get an options page where you can select the type of bullet you prefer for unordered lists. This can be accessed again later by clicking the pencil button at the bottom of the list, then clicking the gear button next to the BulletList extension.


### Slugify

Turn selected text into a URL-friendly post slug: lowercase, hyphens for spaces, and non-alphanumeric characters removed.

Also:

* Accents are folded (`café` → `cafe`)
* `.` → `-dot-`, `+` → `-plus-`, `&` → `-and-`, `@` → `-at-`
* Underscores become hyphens; repeated separators collapse


### Sum

Detect all numbers in selection and total them. Allows decimal places (using `.` or `,` as separator) and negative numbers. Result is copied to clipboard.

Use the options "Separator" and "Decimal Delimiter" to define characters used in your locale for separating thousands and decimal places, respectively.


### Twitterify

Convert all @names and #tags to Markdown or HTML links pointing at **x.com** (profiles and hashtag search). You can set the default link type in the extension's options (**Markdown Links**), and manually switch to the other type by holding down Option when running it.


### URLEncode

Percent-encodes the selected text (`encodeURIComponent`).

*Also available at [Pilot Moon](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions/page/URLEncode), same extension.*


### WebMarkdown

Also known as WebMD, this extension shows up when you select text on a web page. Clicking it will convert the selected headlines, text and links (including image links) to Markdown in your clipboard.

This extension uses [Gather](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/gather-cli) to markdownify the selection. If you don't have the `gather` CLI installed, WebMarkdown will offer to download and install it for you the first time you run it.


### Too Many Wrappers

[Get it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNB8pNqwrKw)

Allows the definition of three custom "wrappers," prefixes and suffixes that will surround selected text. They're triggered, respectively, by clicking with the Option key, Command key or no modifier key held down. 

Think of it as a custom version of the comments plugin. I find it quite handy for adding `<mark>`, `<ins>` and `<del>` tags to text when editing for others.

When installing the extension, the options will appear. They can be accessed again by going into edit mode in the plugins dropdown and clicking the gear icon next to "Wrappers."
